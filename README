Shell script for the lazy.
Usage:
./lazyproject.sh projectname

What this does:

1. Creates the following directory tree by default:
~/Projects/projectname
~/Projects/projectname/assets
~/Projects/projectname/assets/css
~/Projects/projectname/assets/css/vendor
~/Projects/projectname/assets/js
~/Projects/projectname/assets/js/vendor
~/Projects/projectname/assets/images

2. Downloads jQuery 1.7.2 (the most recent at the time of this writing) to the js/vendor directory
3. Writes a basic reset.css to the css directory
4. Creates a blank app.css in the css directory
5. Creates a boilerplace index.html and includes all of the files we created

Customization
Edit lines 10-18 to change directory names, the path to your project folder, and the jQuery version.
